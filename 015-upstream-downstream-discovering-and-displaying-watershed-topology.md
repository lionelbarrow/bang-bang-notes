### Upstream/Downstream: Discovering and Displaying Watershed Topology!

_Mark Philips_

Given any particular spot on the ground, if it rains there, where does the water go? What is downstream from that spot? Conversely, what is upstream from that spot?

Created a really cool program that shows this. Like, this program is super cool (he demoed it). watersheds.fernleafinteractive.com

Each polygon has one polygon downstream of it and several upstream of it. Therefore the entire map forms a directed acyclic graph.
