### Programming Culture

How vs what and why

Programmers talk about how (focusing on particular tools) rather than what the project is trying to achieve -- leads to project failure.

Maybe attributable to way programming is taught. When students leave school they don't know how to actually build things, but they know how things work. We need to teach students how to build things.

Most programming languages are pretty similar. But programmers focus too much on their favorite programming language. Within PLs, people over focus on comparing libraries or frameworks rather than on the problem at hand.

Programming is very artistic and creative because you build things. But artistic people are often pushed away from programming because of the culture of competition.

Ultimately programming is a means to an end. The tool doesn't matter more than what you've made. Rather than focus on the tool, focus on what you've made.
