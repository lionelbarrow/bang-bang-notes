### Convolution and the Fourier Transform: Math!

_Laura Lindzey_

Laura is a geophysicist. They use ground-penetrating radar, mounted on a plane, to study Antarctica.

Cross-correlation (f star g): how similar are f and g? f star g at n = sum (m = - infinity to infinity) f[m] * g[m + n] 

Convolution: also how similar are f and g, but studies magnitudes, not values
