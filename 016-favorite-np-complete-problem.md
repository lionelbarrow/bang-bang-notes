# My Favorite NP Complete Problem

Mark Dominus

NP problems are easy to check that a solution is correct but not necessarily easy to compute the correct solution.

The SAT (satisfiability) problem is this: if someone hands you a logical proposition with variables, is there a set of true and false values you can assign to the variables such that the proposition is true.

If you had a good algorithm for this, you could use it to solve every other problem in NP. SAT would "completely" solve NP; it is therefore "NP-complete". SAT is at least as hard as all other problems in NP.

There are other NP-complete problems: Hamiltonian cycles, for example. Karp gave a list of 21 NP-complete problems in 1972. A solution to any one of them would completely solve NP and therefore also solve the other 20.

Since then, people have discovered hundreds of NP problems.
