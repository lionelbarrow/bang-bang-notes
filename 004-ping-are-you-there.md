### Ping! Are you there?

_Lydia Gu_

Layered model of entowrking: transport, network, link.

Transport: retransmission, congestion control, etc (TCP)
Network: routing (IP)
Link: protocol for data exchange between 2 physical devices

Smurf attack: puts victims network broadcast IP in the "send me stuff" part of an echo request to a network. This amplifies the size of the pings by the size of the network.
