# A Million Things To Do With A Computer

tef

Scratch has these philosophies:
* Low floors - easy to get started
* Wide walls - plenty of things to do
* High ceilings - sky's the limit

Scratch is secretly a Lisp. Logo is Scratch's predecessor and it comes from a paper in the 60s about teaching computers to kids titled "20 things to do with a computer". Things 1-20 were "build a robot and do cool things with it". This process emphasized feedback, play, exploration.

Logo was extrapolated on by Mindstorms by Seymour Papert (the Lego thing was named after this). In this book Papert talks about what he calls the "math world" which is an internal world in the programmers head.

This emphasizes "coding to learn" not "learning to code". The point of the 20 things to do with a computer paper was on how computers can enable kids to have agency, to use computers as a medium for learning.

Scratch has a cat named Felix. Felix is a puppet on a stage.

Instead of using ASCII-art to describe the program, Scratch uses a block oriented interface. Scratch is syntax free. When you have no syntax you have no syntax errors.

Scratch's lack of syntax in the language core makes it much easier to make it multilingual.

Downsides to blocks: no autocomplete. Harder to write large programs, but this is mostly due to the emphasis placed on the programming language so far.

Scratch is finally being open sourced. But more than just a programming environment, it's also a community. Scratch is a world where 'View Source' still works. tef's favorite project was a kid who made his own game, but he made it too hard. So he had to implement cheats.

Philosophy again:
* low floors: no syntax, no stumbling blocks
* wide walls: lots of addons, rich library
* high ceilings: hardware support, lots of extensions

The slides are all also in Scratch

Your programming languages could be so much better. So, so much better. The main reason Scratch is so amazing is that the community hasn't learned from us.
