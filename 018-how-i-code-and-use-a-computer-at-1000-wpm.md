# How I code and use a computer at 1000 WPM!

Sina does a shoutout to Mirabai our awesome transcriber.

Sina googles some stuff and his computer talks out the text of the impossibly fast for us to understranding like way too fast.

He then types into the terminal -- looks like he used top -- and the computer continues to spit the text out impossibly fast. He also puts some techno on.

He then slows down the screen reader and it becomes intelligible.

For capital letters the screen reader raises its pitch. This is an example of multimodal presentation -- presenting through different channels. This is a more efficient way of highlighting the capital letter than saying "capital C". Similarly the reader says "unavailable" instead of "greyed out" for disabled menu options.

Who has used an a-tag styled as a button? We have to make sure to use HTML to communicate the semantic meaning of the text and use CSS to style it. Headings aren't to make text big!

Ars technica's website is pretty organized.

Hacker News isn't semantically laid out and it's very hard to navigate using the speech reader. Reddit also isn't laid out well. Unlabeled link text really matters. Always have alt text on graphics. 

Sina's interaction with technology is mediated by software such as a screen reader. But bear in mind that other users of the website is also mediated through technology such as search enginer crawlers.

The W3C web content accessability guidelines are really useful.

This accessibility is built directly into their iPhone. iOS has all kinds of accessibility stuff built in, including a computer vision program for controlling the phone with head movements for people who are paralyzed.
